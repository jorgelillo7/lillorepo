# Pending work

Long-running follow-ups that don't yet warrant a plan or PR.

**Rules of the file:**
- Never deleted; lives at the repo root.
- Lines are pruned as items ship or stop being relevant — keep it short.
- Group items by package; use `infra` for cross-cutting GCP/CI/policy tasks.
- "What has shipped" lives in `packages/biwenger_tools/release-notes.md` — do not duplicate here.

## infra

- **Drive folder cleanup** (USER-OWNED, week of 2026-05-26) — when the league ends:
  delete the Drive folder contents (the old CSVs the scraper used to upload), then
  drop the `biwenger-tools-sa-regional` secret or repoint it to a Sheets-only SA
  (Sheets API still authenticates through that mount for `ligas_especiales` /
  `trofeos`).
- **Keyless deploy via Workload Identity Federation** (audit 2026-07-11) — replace
  the long-lived `GCP_SA_KEY` JSON in GitHub Secrets with WIF/OIDC:
  create the pool+provider once, switch the five `google-github-actions/auth@v3`
  blocks in `deploy.yml` to `workload_identity_provider` + `service_account`,
  then delete the secret.
- **Deferred audit items** (audit 2026-07-11, revisit when bored): reusable
  deploy workflow, gradual mypy, parametrised `base_deps` in `python_service`,
  Dockerfile.base generated from the lock, move `scripts/biwenger_*.py` into the
  package, `docs/README.md` index, dependabot for actions, typed SDK exceptions,
  ruff migration, coverage in CI.

## my_photos

- **Photo-recognition project** — tracked in `packages/my_photos/README.md`, not here.
