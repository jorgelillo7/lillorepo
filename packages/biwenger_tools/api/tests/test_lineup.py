"""Tests for `_pick_captain`, `format_lineup_message`, and the live-MV
override in `build_squad_rows`.

`_pick_captain` operates on rows whose `price` is already the per-league
live market value (see `build_squad_rows`), so the 3M cap is exact — no
margin needed. A row with `price=0` ("unknown") is excluded; the caller
applies the lineup without a captain when nobody qualifies.
