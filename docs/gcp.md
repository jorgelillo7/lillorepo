## Secrets

| Secret | Contents |
|---|---|
| `biwenger-credentials-regional` | `{"email", "password", "gdrive_folder_id", "jp_auth_token"}` |
| `telegram-bot-config-regional` | `{"bot_token", "chat_id", "webhook_secret"}` |
| `chucknorris-bot-config-regional` | `{"bot_token", "webhook_secret"}` |
| `biwenger-tools-sa-regional` | Google Drive service account JSON key |

All secrets are regional (`europe-southwest1`). See "Cost decisions" below.

## Cost decisions

### Regional secrets, not global
Secret Manager charges per active version (first 6 free/month). Global replication
adds a replica per region you use, counting as extra versions. Using
`--replication-policy=user-managed --locations=europe-southwest1` keeps each secret
at exactly 1 active version.

### JSON secrets — one secret, multiple values
Consolidating related credentials into a single JSON secret (e.g., `biwenger-credentials-regional`
instead of separate `biwenger-email`, `biwenger-password`, `gdrive-folder-id`) reduces
active secret count from 9 to 4, staying well within the free tier.
Config modules read the JSON first, fall back to individual env vars for local dev.

The `jp_auth_token` (Jornada Perfecta) was added to `biwenger-credentials-regional` in
2026-05-16 instead of creating a new secret — same scope (teams_analyzer), no extra cost.

### Shared Python base image
All Cloud Run services and jobs extend a shared `python-base` image stored in Artifact Registry.
This is rebuilt only when dependencies change, not on every deploy. Benefits:
- Cold start time drops significantly (heavy deps like `google-cloud-*` are pre-installed).
- Artifact Registry storage stays low — only incremental layers change per deploy.

### min-instances = 0 on all services
No idle compute billing. All services are request-driven or job-driven.
Acceptable because this is a private league intranet, not a latency-sensitive product.

### Bots with cpu=0.5 + concurrency=1
`biwenger-telegram-bot` and `chucknorris-bot` are webhook handlers that do at most one
HTTP call per request (fan-out to a Cloud Run Job or fetch from chucknorris.io). They
serve one request per instance and scale horizontally if a second arrives in flight.
GCP forbids `cpu < 1` with `concurrency > 1`, so this is the configuration that buys
the cpu reduction. The web service stays at `cpu=1 concurrency=80` — it serves a
real browser audience and benefits from sharing one instance across requests.

### Log retention 7 days
The `_Default` log bucket retains for 7 days (down from the GCP default of 30). At our
volume we stay far below the 50 GB/month free ingestion, but a shorter retention caps
the long-tail storage cost as the project grows and gives us a smaller window when
debugging — by design, recent issues are the only ones worth debugging.

### Budget alert at €1/month
A budget named "€1 Alerta de presupuesto mensual" fires email alerts at 50%, 90%,
100% and 150% of €1 EUR. €1 is a meaningful threshold given we should be on the
free tier; any breach is a signal that something has escaped the constraints, not a
normal-operations event.

### Artifact Registry cleanup includes every service
`scripts/clean-images-artifact.sh` purges old digests per image. Note that the
`SIMPLE_IMAGES` array must list **every** Cloud Run service/job repo — `chucknorris_bot`
was missing until 2026-05-16 and quietly accumulated 8 digests. When adding a new
service, add its repo name to that array. `python-base` is multi-arch and managed
separately (deletes only orphan untagged digests older than 24 h).

The script is invoked by CI's `cleanup` job after any successful deploy. If a week
passes without merges, run it manually.

### Cloud Run instead of GCE/GKE
Serverless — no VM management, no always-on cost. Free tier: 2M requests/month,
360k vCPU-seconds, 180k GiB-seconds (shared across all services and jobs).

### europe-southwest1 (Madrid)
Chosen for latency to users (all Spanish), not for cost. Pricing is equivalent to
other European regions.
